BumpMapx is to preserve the original Colors
EmbossX is for image file overlays or recoloring of the bevel

Azimuth is the light rotation

Elevation is the bumpmap's angle

Depth enhances the bevel by darkening its inners

Internal Median Blur Radius is the main control of the bevel effect

Interal Median Percentile sliders makes the bevel slim if down and fat if slide up. 
Play around with the two to find the best setting. Certain combinations ruin the bevel. I do
not really understand what the internal medians do but I kept them for unique customizations.

Internal Gaussian makes the bevel smooth and even puffy on high settings and hard edged on its lower setting.

Desaturate is deprecated and will be removed in future releases

Lightness makes the color brighter.

EmbossX setting is used for recoloring and image file overlays. To use image file overlays change BumpMapX to EmbossX.
