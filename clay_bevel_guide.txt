Preserve color mode is to preserve the original Colors
Color and Image file overlay mode is for image file overlays or recoloring of the bevel

Azimuth is the light rotation

Elevation is the bumpmap's angle

Depth enhances the bevel by darkening its inners

Internal Median Blur Radius is the main control of the bevel effect

Interal Median Percentile sliders makes the bevel slim if down and fat if slide up. 
Play around with the two to find the best setting. Certain combinations ruin the bevel. I do
not really understand what the internal medians do but I kept them for unique customizations.

Internal Gaussian makes the bevel smooth and even puffy on high settings and hard edged on its lower setting.

Lightness makes the color brighter.

Recolor and Image file overlay recommend changing modes from Preserve Color to Color and Image Overlay. If not it will produce an effect similar to be multiply blend mode.
